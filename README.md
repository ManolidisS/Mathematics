# Mathematics Library
To do basic mathematical operations in Python, you can either use the built-in operands `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `**`, etc., or you can use the `math` library, also directly built-in Python.
But what if you wanted to compute the dot product of a matrix? What if you wanted to calculate binomials?
There is probably some boring, ultra-efficient method on Stack Overflow ðŸ¥±, or instead you can use **my** incredible mathematics library (which is probably very efficient).

Honestly idk this is just a project for fun, but I might use it one day :)
